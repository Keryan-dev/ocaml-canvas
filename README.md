OCaml-Canvas
============

The OCaml-Canvas library provides a portable Canvas framework for OCaml.
It features an interface similar to HTML5 Canvas, and can render to
native X11, MS Windows or macOS windows. It also features a small
wrapper around HTML5 Canvas, allowing to use the library in any web
browser. In addition, it allows to handle keyboard and mouse events.
